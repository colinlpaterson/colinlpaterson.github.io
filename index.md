Welcome! I'm Colin Paterson, an analyst interested in programming, finance (computational finance), and collaborating with like minded peers. 

I've worked in financial services for 20+ years. I stumbled into programming ~8 years ago without a formal technical background. The more I do it, the more I learn, enjoy it, and appreciate its reach and power to solve problems.

This blog covers computational finance with a focus on R programming, but I also work with SQL, Python, and of course Excel.

Thanks for visiting!
