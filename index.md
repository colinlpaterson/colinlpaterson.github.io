Welcome! I'm Colin Paterson, an analyst interested in programming, finance (computational finance), and collaborating with like minded peers. 

I've worked in financial services for 20+ years in various roles - customer service, commercial lending (sales, underwriting, portfolio management), and an analyst (lending, finance, treasury). I stumbled into programming ~8 years ago without a formal technical background. The more I program, the more I enjoy it, and appreciate its reach and power to solve problems.

This blog covers computational finance with a focus on R programming, but I also work with SQL, Python, Java and of course Excel.

Thanks for visiting!
